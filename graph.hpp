// C++ is somewhat obnoxious here:  You can't do a circular
// reference, so we declare all the classes we will use all up here
// and then declare the bodies later.

// Additionally, since we are doing things with parameterized typing
// on how we name the Graph nodes, basically ALL the code needs to
// be in the header, as C++'s parameterization is effectively textual
// substitution: replacing the typename T with whatever type is actually
// used in the code.

// The primary class for a Graph.

// This implementation uses an adjacency list within each node (so each node has
// a set of all edges to or from that node, with each edge knowing which
// nodes it starts and ends with), and the Graph
// itself has a name->node mapping.

// We have to be careful here in distinguishing between std::shared_ptr and
// std::weak_ptr, in order to prevent cycles in the data structure.  The idea:
// The Graph class itself has a std::shared_ptr to each node in the Graph.
// Thats fine, now when the Graph is removed all the nodes will be removed.

// And each node has a shared_ptr to each edge which starts or ends
// at this node, which again is fine as when a node is deleted it will
// delete its edges.

// The problem comes with the link from the edges back to the nodes.
// If we used std::shared_ptr here, this would mean a node could never
// be deleted because an edge would refer to it, and the edge wouldn't be deleted
// because a node was referring to it, creating a cyclic structure.

// Thus we have the pointers in the edges be typed as std::weak_ptr instead.  A
// weak pointer is a "safe" placeholder.  As is, the weak pointer does not count
// as a reference for cleanup purposes, so an edge won't keep a node around needlessly.
// But a weak pointer can't also be accessed directly, instead one needs to
// convert it to a shared_pointer by either calling lock() (which returns a shared
// pointer or nullptr if the underlying object has been freed), or by calling
// std::shared_ptr's constructor on a weak-pointer (which will throw a std::bad_weak_ptr
// exception if the data was already freed)
